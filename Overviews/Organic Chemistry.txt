|          OVERVIEW OF : Organic Chemistry          |
=====================================================
| Paula Bruice’s presentation in Organic            |
| Chemistry, Eighth Edition provides mixed-science  |
| majors with the conceptual foundations,           |
| chemical logic, and problem-solving               |
| skills they need to reason their way to           |
| solutions for diverse problems in synthetic       |
| organic chemistry, biochemistry, and medicine.    |
| The Eighth Edition builds a strong framework      |
| for thinking about organic chemistry by unifying  |
| principles of reactivity that students will       |
| apply throughout the course, discouraging         |
| memorization. With more applications              |
| than any other textbook, Dr. Bruice consistently  |
| relates structure and reactivity to what occurs   |
| in our own cells and reinforces the fundamental   |
| reason for all chemical reactions-electrophiles   |
| react with nucleophiles. New streamlined          |
| coverage of substitution and elimination,         |
| updated problem-solving strategies, synthesis     |
| skill-building applications and tutorials         |
| guide students throughout fundamental             |
| and complex content in both the first and second  |
| semesters of the course.                          |
