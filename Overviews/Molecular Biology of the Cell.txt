|          OVERVIEW OF : Molecular Biology of the Cell          |
=================================================================
| As the amount of information in biology expands               |
| dramatically, it becomes increasingly important for           |
| textbooks to distill the vast amount of scientific            |
| knowledge into concise principles and enduring concepts.As    |
| with previous editions, Molecular Biology of the Cell, Sixth  |
| Edition accomplishes this goal with clear writing and         |
| beautiful illustrations. The Sixth Edition has been           |
| extensively revised and updated with the latest research      |
| in the field of cell biology, and it provides an exceptional  |
| framework for teaching and learning. The entire illustration  |
| program has been greatly enhanced.Protein structures          |
| better illustrate structure-function relationships,           |
| icons are simpler and more consistent within and between      |
| chapters, and micrographs have been refreshed and updated     |
| with newer, clearer, or better images. As a new feature,      |
| each chapter now contains intriguing openended questions      |
| highlighting "What We Don’t Know," introducing students       |
| to challenging areas of future research. Updated              |
| end-of-chapter problems reflect new research discussed        |
| in the text, and these problems have been expanded to all     |
| chapters by adding questions on developmental biology,        |
| tissues and stem cells, pathogens, and the immune system.     |
|                                                               |
