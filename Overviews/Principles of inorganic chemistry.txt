|          OVERVIEW OF : Principles of inorganic chemistry          |
=====================================================================
| Aimed at senior undergraduates and first-year graduate students,  |
| this book offers a principles-based approach to inorganic         |
| chemistry that, unlike other texts, uses chemical applications    |
| of group theory and molecular orbital theory throughout           |
| as an underlying framework. This highly physical approach         |
| allows students to derive the greatest benefit of topics such     |
| as molecular orbital acid-base theory, band theory of solids,     |
| and inorganic photochemistry, to name a few. Takes a              |
| principles-based, group and molecular orbital theory approach     |
| to inorganic chemistry The first inorganic chemistry textbook     |
| to provide a thorough treatment of group theory, a topic usually  |
| relegated to only one or two chapters of texts, giving it only    |
| a cursory overview Covers atomic and molecular term symbols,      |
| symmetry coordinates in vibrational spectroscopy using the        |
| projection operator method, polyatomic MO theory, band theory,    |
| and Tanabe-Sugano diagrams Includes a heavy dose of group theory  |
| in the primary inorganic textbook, most of the pedagogical        |
| benefits of integration and reinforcement of this material        |
| in the treatment of other topics, such as frontier MO acid--base  |
| theory, band theory of solids, inorganic photochemistry,          |
| the Jahn-Teller effect, and Wade's rules are fully realized       |
| Very physical in nature compare to other textbooks in the field,  |
| taking the time to go through mathematical derivations            |
| and to compare and contrast different theories of bonding         |
| in order to allow for a more rigorous treatment of their          |
| application to molecular structure, bonding, and spectroscopy     |
| Informal and engaging writing style; worked examples throughout   |
| the text; unanswered problems in every chapter; contains          |
| a generous use of informative, colorful illustrations             |
|                                                                   |
