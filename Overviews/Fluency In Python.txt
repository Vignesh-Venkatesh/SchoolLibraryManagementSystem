=====================================================
| Python's simplicity lets you become productive    |
| quickly, but this often means you aren t using    |
| everything it has to offer. With this hands-on    |
| guide, you ll learn how to write effective,       |
| idiomatic Python code by leveraging its best      |
| and possibly most neglected features. Author      |
| Luciano Ramalho takes you through Python's        |
| core language features and libraries, and shows   |
| you how to make your code shorter, faster,        |
| and more readable at the same time. Many          |
| experienced programmers try to bend Python        |
| to fit patterns they learned from other           |
| languages, and never discover Python features     |
| outside of their experience. With this book,      |
| those Python programmers will thoroughly          |
| learn how to become proficient in Python 3. This  |
| book covers: Python data model: understand        |
| how special methods are the key to the            |
| consistent behavior of objects; Data structures:  |
| take full advantage of built-in types, and        |
| understand the text vs bytes duality in the       |
| Unicode age; Functions as objects: view Python    |
| functions as first-class objects, and understand  |
| how this affects popular design patterns;         |
| Object-oriented idioms: build classes by          |
| learning about references, mutability,            |
| interfaces, operator overloading, and multiple    |
| inheritance; Control flow: leverage context       |
| managers, generators, coroutines, and             |
| concurrency with the concurrent.futures           |
| and asyncio packages; Metaprogramming:            |
| understand how properties, attribute              |
| descriptors, class decorators, and metaclasses    |
| work.                                             |
